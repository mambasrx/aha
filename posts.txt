I refuse to acknowledge any cheese that isn’t at least five years old.  
I once had an argument with a goose and lost.  
I don’t understand people who don’t own a Thermos flask.  
I once bought a caravan on impulse and regretted it instantly.  
Lynn, I’m considering writing a novel about a man who invents a new type of bread.  
I’ve never met a man who could correctly tie a bow tie.  
I once mistook an owl for a cat.  
I refuse to wear shorts because I don’t trust my own knees.  
Lynn, if I ever win the lottery, I’m going to buy a castle and fill it with deck chairs.  
I once saw a man eat an entire cucumber in one go and I’ve never recovered.  
I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in slightly haunted chairs.
