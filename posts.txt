I refuse to wear shorts because I don’t trust my own knees.  
Lynn, if I ever win the lottery, I’m going to buy a castle and fill it with deck chairs.  
I once saw a man eat an entire cucumber in one go and I’ve never recovered.  
I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in slightly haunted chairs.
