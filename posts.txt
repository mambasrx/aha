Got my fungal foot powder? Ah, it’s a lifesaver, you know. I’d effectively be disabled if it weren’t for these.
There’s never any graffiti in the hotel. Although in the gents a couple of weeks ago, I did see someone had drawn a lady’s part. Quite detailed. The guy had talent.
Would it be terribly rude to do listening to you and go speak to someone else?
