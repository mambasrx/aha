Aha!
I’m 47; my girlfriend’s 33. She’s 14 years younger than me. Back of the net!
My heart is, in the wise words of Billy Ray Cyrus, achy breaky.
As I write these words I’m noisily chomping away on not one, but two Murray Mints.
That was the best full English breakfast I’ve had since Gary Wilmot’s wedding.
I love you in a way.
Kommen Sie bitte, und listen to Kraftwerk.
Wings are the band The Beatles could've been.
You work in a petrol station Michael. It's not the Gulf War. Which ironically is like a large petrol station.
Yes, it's an extender! Fantastic. That is the icing on the cake. You know, if King Arthur had an extender on his table...
Would you like me to lap dance for you?
Right, OK. Shoestring, Taggart, Spender, Bergerac, Morse. What does that say to you about regional detective series?
Oh God, no, no, I'm old enough to be her father! Well, her older brother. Either way it's incest.
Lion bar?
No, I always put my money there in the evening. No, if it was you could add a zero to that. It's seven pounds six.
I will not have uncleansed coffee cups in Pear Tree Productions. The plague started from a mal-attended surface.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! That's English for stop a horse!
Putting a damp spoon back in the bowl is the tea-drinking equivalent of sharing a needle. And I did not want to end up with the tea-drinking equivalent of AIDS.
And I came to a startling but unshakeable conclusion: no genuinely good music has been created since 1988.
Snowflakes fell from the sky like tiny pieces of a snowman who had stood on a landmine.
I found it hidden in an air vent behind a wardrobe. It was just sat there looking at me, like some sort of confectionary Anne Frank.
I'll be asking, which is the worst monger? Fish, iron, rumour, or war?
You know who I am, I've not been off TV for that long! Identify yourself.
Get rid of her, Lynn, she's a drunk and a racist! I'll tolerate one, but not both.
Go to your muster stations... it's Bryan Ferry.
Let me tell you something about the Titanic: people forget that on the Titanic’s maiden voyage, there were over 1000 miles of uneventful, very pleasurable cruising before it hit the iceberg.
Go to London, and I guarantee you’ll either be mugged or not appreciated.
No, I don’t smoke. I’m one of the anti-cancer set. We’re a dying breed. Well, we’re not, you are. I don’t mean you’ve got cancer. Maybe you have.
Got my fungal foot powder? Ah, it’s a lifesaver, you know. I’d effectively be disabled if it weren’t for these.
There’s never any graffiti in the hotel. Although in the gents a couple of weeks ago, I did see someone had drawn a lady’s part. Quite detailed. The guy had talent.
Would it be terribly rude to do listening to you and go speak to someone else?
Lynn, I’ve pierced my foot on a spiiiike!
Smell my cheese, you mother!
Sunday Bloody Sunday. What a great song. It really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday, doesn’t it?
It’s hotter than the sun!
They’ve rebadged it, you fool!
I ate a scotch egg in a minicab on the way here. I’m bursting with meat.
Lynn, some of these people have come from Stoke.
Stop getting Bond wrong!
This is Radio Norwich, and I’m Alan Partridge. What’s your favourite Beatles album? ‘Tough one’, I hear you say. Best of The Beatles?
Do you want me to lap you?
That was classic intercourse.
Jurassic Park!
Cashback!
Dan! Dan! DAN! DAN! DAAAAAN!
I’m afraid I can’t come to the door right now as I’m trapped under a boulder.
You’re just making noises. That’s not an apology.
Monkey tennis?
Smashy and Nicey, more like Smashy and F*** Offy!
Lynn, I’m not driving a Mini Metro. I’d rather drive a Lexus with tinted windows and be a drug dealer.
